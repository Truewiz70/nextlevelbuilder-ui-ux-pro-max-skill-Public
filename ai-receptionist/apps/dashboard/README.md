# Dashboard (Next.js)

The tenant-facing web app: call history with transcripts, analytics, appointments, the
callback queue, CRM sync failures, and settings (persona, timezone, Google/HubSpot connect).

## Purpose

Lets a practice's staff see what the AI receptionist did and change how it behaves, without
engineering involvement. Delivered in Phase 7 (M5).

## Stack

Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict), Tailwind CSS 4, Geist fonts,
Phosphor icons. No client-side data fetching library and no UI kit.

## How it talks to the API

Every API call is made **server-side** (Server Components, Server Actions, one route
handler) with the user's access token, which lives in an `httpOnly` cookie. The browser
never sees the token and never calls the API directly — so the API needs no browser CORS
access for this app, and a script injected into a page cannot read the token.

- `src/lib/api.ts` — the one place that attaches the Bearer token, parses the API's
  `{error: {code, message}}` envelope into `ApiError`, and on a 401 sends the user through
  `/api/auth/logout` (the only place that can clear the cookie) to `/login`.
- `src/lib/types.ts` — response types, **hand-written** to mirror
  `apps/api/src/app/modules/*/schemas.py`. See Known risks.
- `src/middleware.ts` — redirects to `/login` when there is no session cookie. This is a
  convenience check only; authorization is enforced by the API on every request.
- `src/app/api/integrations/[provider]/connect/route.ts` — asks the API for the provider's
  authorize URL (a browser navigation cannot carry a Bearer token) and redirects there.
  The provider later redirects to the API's `/callback`, which redirects back to
  `/settings?connected=...`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `API_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Where the dashboard's *server* reaches the API |

The API must be configured with `DASHBOARD_BASE_URL` (this app's public URL) so the OAuth
callback can redirect back here, and `PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` for the provider redirect URI.

## Running

```bash
make dashboard-install   # npm install
make dev                 # API on :8000 (separate terminal)
make dashboard-dev       # dashboard on :3000
make dashboard-build     # production build + typecheck
```

Sign in with the tenant's `dashboard:` credentials from its `config/tenants/*.yaml`
(created by `make seed`): business ID is the tenant slug, e.g. `bright-smile-dental`.

## Roles

`viewer` can read everything. `admin` and `owner` can cancel appointments, work callbacks,
edit settings, and connect integrations. The UI hides controls a viewer cannot use; the API
is what actually refuses them (403).

## Known risks / future improvements

- **Types can drift from the API.** They are hand-written. Generate them from the FastAPI
  OpenAPI spec (`packages/shared-types`) once the surface stabilises.
- **No automated frontend tests yet.** Phase 7 verified it by driving a production build
  against the live API with a real browser; that script is not committed.
- Sessions are a single 60-minute token with no refresh; expiry means signing in again.
- Not built: knowledge-base editor, qualification-question and escalation-policy editing,
  user management, password change.
