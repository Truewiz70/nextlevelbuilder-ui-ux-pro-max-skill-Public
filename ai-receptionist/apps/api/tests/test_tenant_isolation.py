"""Tenant isolation is enforced by Postgres RLS, not by application code.

That makes it worth testing the *mechanism* and not just its outcomes: the
policies can be flawless and still enforce nothing if the role the app
connects as is allowed to bypass them. A superuser (which is what the
official Postgres image makes POSTGRES_USER) bypasses RLS unconditionally —
`\\d` still prints the policies, every query still returns the "right" rows in
single-tenant testing, and the boundary is simply absent.

These tests fail loudly in that configuration.
