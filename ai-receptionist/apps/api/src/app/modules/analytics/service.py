"""Dashboard KPI rollups (FR-11: call volume, outcomes, booking rate,
escalation rate, sentiment).

Deliberately no new event-ingestion pipeline or rollup table — every number
here is a read-side aggregate over `calls`, which the telephony/post-call
modules already write during a normal call. A rollup table becomes worth
the write-side complexity if these queries ever show up in a slow-query log;
nothing about the schema or this module's shape would need to change to add
one later, since callers only ever see `AnalyticsSummary`.

Rates are computed against *classified* calls, not all calls in the window —
a call the post-call worker hasn't reached yet has `outcome IS NULL`, and
counting it in the denominator would silently understate every rate for the
last few minutes of the window, worst right after a burst of call volume.
