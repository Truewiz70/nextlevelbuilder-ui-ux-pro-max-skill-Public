"""CalendarProvider — booking backends (Google Calendar first; Cal.com later).

The scheduling module owns availability rules, conflict prevention, and
idempotency; this interface only reads free/busy and writes events. The
calendar is the source of truth for bookings — the local `appointments` row
mirrors it for reporting.
