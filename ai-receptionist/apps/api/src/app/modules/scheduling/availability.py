"""Availability maths: turn a tenant's business hours into bookable slots.

Deliberately pure — no database, no calendar, no clock of its own. Everything
it needs is passed in, which is what makes the timezone and boundary rules
(the parts that actually break in production) cheap to test exhaustively.

Business hours are local to the tenant's timezone; slots are computed in that
local frame and returned as UTC-aware datetimes so every downstream
comparison is unambiguous.
