"""CRM synchronization: resumable, per-step, never duplicating.

## Why this is not just "call three endpoints"

A sync is three writes against an API with no idempotency key: upsert the
contact, log the call, create the deal. Any of them can fail. If the job is
simply retried from the top, the steps that already succeeded run again — and
`create_deal` has no natural key, so the practice ends up with two deals for
one phone call. Duplicates in a customer's CRM are worse than a missing
record: they get noticed, and a human has to merge them.

So each external id is written to `crm_syncs` the moment it is obtained, and
every attempt skips the steps that already have one:

    attempt 1:  contact ✓ (id saved)  activity ✓ (id saved)  deal ✗ ── raise
    attempt 2:  contact skipped        activity skipped        deal ✓

The ledger row is found via a unique idempotency key, so two workers handling
the same job converge on one row rather than two. Converging on one row is
not by itself enough: the queue's delivery guarantee is at-least-once (see
core/queue.py), so a worker presumed dead can be reclaimed while genuinely
still running, and the reclaimed job then executes concurrently with its
"zombie" original. Both would see the same NULL columns and both write.

`_claim_attempt` closes that gap with an atomic status transition — only one
concurrent caller can move the row from `pending`/`failed` (or a stale
`in_progress`) to `in_progress`; the loser does no work at all rather than
racing step-by-step.

Nothing here runs on the call path.
