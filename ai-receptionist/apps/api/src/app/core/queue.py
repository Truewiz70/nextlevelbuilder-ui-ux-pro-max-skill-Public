"""Redis-backed job queue for the async post-call path, with retries,
exponential backoff, and dead-lettering.

## Delivery guarantees, stated plainly

Jobs are **at-least-once**. Every handler must therefore be idempotent — that
is an invariant of this module, not a suggestion, and the reclaim behaviour
below depends on it.

A job moves through three Redis keys:

    queue:<name>            the ready list        (BLMOVE source)
    queue:<name>:processing in-flight             (BLMOVE destination)
    queue:<name>:delayed    ZSET, score = ready-at (retries waiting on backoff)
    queue:<name>:dead       terminal failures, bounded

Taking a job is `BLMOVE ready -> processing`, so a worker that dies mid-job
leaves the payload in `processing` rather than losing it. `reclaim_orphans`
moves anything stranded there back onto the ready list at startup. With more
than one worker on a queue a restart can re-deliver a peer's in-flight job;
idempotent handlers absorb that, which is the trade we are making instead of
per-message visibility timeouts.

## Retry policy

Transient failures (5xx, timeouts, rate limits) are retried with exponential
backoff plus jitter — jitter matters because a vendor outage fails every job
at once and un-jittered backoff would retry them in a thundering herd.

`PermanentIntegrationError` skips retries entirely and dead-letters at once: a
400 from a vendor means the payload is wrong, and sending it five more times
just delays the alert.
