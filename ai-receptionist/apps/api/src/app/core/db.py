"""Async database engine, sessions, and tenant-scoped RLS sessions.

Multi-tenant isolation is enforced in PostgreSQL via row-level security.
Every tenant-scoped query must run through `tenant_session()`, which sets the
`app.tenant_id` connection variable that the RLS policies check. The
application connects as a non-superuser role (`receptionist_app` in
production) so policies cannot be bypassed.
