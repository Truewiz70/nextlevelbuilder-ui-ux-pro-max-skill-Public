-- Runs once, as the bootstrap superuser, on first container start.

-- Why this file exists: PostgreSQL superusers bypass Row-Level Security
-- unconditionally — FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY does not apply to them. The
-- official image makes POSTGRES_USER a superuser, so an application that
-- connects as POSTGRES_USER gets *no* tenant isolation at all, while every
-- policy still looks correct in \d output. Dev would silently disagree with
-- production, and cross-tenant leaks would pass their own tests.
--
-- So the container bootstraps as `postgres` and the application connects as
-- `receptionist`, which is deliberately NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS. Keep it that
-- way in every environment: the RLS policies are the tenant boundary.
