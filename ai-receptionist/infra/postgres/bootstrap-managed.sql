-- One-time setup for a MANAGED Postgres (Railway, Neon, RDS...), run as the
-- provider's admin login. The compose stack does the equivalent in
-- init/00-app-role.sql.
--
--   psql "$ADMIN_DATABASE_URL" -v app_password="$(openssl rand -hex 24)" \
--        -f infra/postgres/bootstrap-managed.sql
--
-- Then point the application's DATABASE_URL at `receptionist_app`, never at the
-- admin login. Why this is not optional: managed providers hand out a
-- superuser, and superusers bypass row-level security unconditionally — every
-- policy still shows in \d, queries still succeed, and tenants can read each
-- other's data with no error. The API and workers check for this at startup in
-- staging/production and refuse to run (core/db.py: ensure_rls_enforced).
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run, e.g. to rotate the password.
-- Requires the pgvector extension to be installable on the server. A plain
-- Postgres service on some providers does not ship it — use their pgvector
-- image/template.
